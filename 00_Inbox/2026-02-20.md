## Capture
- Thoughts on how Sales team everywhere is purely driven close view to what their KPI number is. Wrongly set KPI and number will make them chase after the wrong things. This needs to be constantly evaluated. For example, our team is fixated on number of gross adds. This is being done without considering whether dealer are able to absorb or sell out the products.

## Insights
- Someone can be really deep in the well and unable to look at the bigger picture. I wonder whether this can be fixed by training or education. I feel there's a lot of handholding to be done for this person to grow to a different level
## For Tomorrow
- Develop a summary of U9 AOP Marketing Expense and how it relate to ROI. I got a feeling it is going to be asked by the shareholder.
